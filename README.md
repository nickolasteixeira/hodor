## About
Many online contests make gathering votes a part of their process for choosing winners. The problem is that a lot of them are designed with flaws. How do you beat the system and vote multiple times?

## Requirements
- Python3
- Requests Module

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
`https://github.com/nickolasteixeira/hodor.git`

2. Run the scripts
`./level_0/0.py`
- While running the scripts, there will be an output of the number of times you voted

3. Check the votes
- Look at the votes before and after running the scripts. 
- URLs are provided in each folder

## Example
```
NickolasTeixeira$ ./level_0/0.py
Voted 1 times.
Voted 2 times.
Voted 3 times.
Voted 4 times.
...
Voted 1024 times.
```
